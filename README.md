Code and raw data for the aging mode analysis study.    
Dataset consisted of 44 NMC/Gr single layer pouch cells.  
Capacity, Columbic efficiency, end of charge voltage (EOCV), and end of discharge voltage (EODV) are included. 

###  Getting Started
A summary of the 44 cells' information can be found in `summary.xlxs`.  
Use `openPouchSummary.py` to select the cells to be analyzed. 

###  Run the analysis 
Use `detrendCBCdict.py` to  
Use `fcnCBCdict.py` to  
Use `Main_LLI_LAM_Classification.py`to  
Use `Main_LAM_estimation.py`to
